SELECT
    Orders.OrderID,
    Orders.OrderDate,
    Customersu.CustomerName

       e1.EmployeeName AS Employee1_Name,
       e2.EmployeeID AS Employee2_ID, 
       e2.EmployeeName AS Employee2_Name,
       e1.DepartmentID
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2
  ON e1.DepartmentID = e2.DepartmentID
  AND e1.EmployeeID < e2.EmployeeID
ORDER BY e1.DepartmentID, e1.EmployeeID, e2.EmployeeID;

SELECT p.ProductID, 
       p.ProductName, 
       c.CategoryID,
